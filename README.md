I followed this [Ruby on Rails tutorial] to create a basic blog page that runs on my local server. The tutorial helped me understand the core concepts of Rails and how controllers, routes, actions and views all worked together.

I've only created one other projects using Rails (click [here]), and it was actually more complicated than this one. I found that going back to basics is actually very beneficial, even though it is an easier project. The practise certainly helps too, as I'm still new to projects that have so many files and uses databases.
