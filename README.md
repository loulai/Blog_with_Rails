I followed this [Ruby on Rails tutorial] to create a basic blog page that runs on my local server. The tutorial helped me understand the core concepts of Rails, and especially how controllers, routes, actions and views all work together.

At the time of this blog's creation, I've only created one other project using Rails (click [here]), and it was actually more complex (using AJAX, JQuery, Mustache, JSON that this project omits). But even so, I find that going back to basics is actually very beneficial even though the project is easier. The practise certainly helps too, as I'm still new to projects that have so many files and that uses databases.
